### Description
**Pomodoro clock** is a simple timer. Its objective is to assist in concentration at work and studies using the Pomodoro technique. 
### Inspiration
This project is the solution to the challenge **Build at 25 + 5 Clock**, proposed by the teaching platform [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) in the certification of Front End Development Libraries. 
### Technologies
- React (functional components)
- Redux (Toolkit)
- Bootstrap
- SASS
- JavaScript ES6
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
### Tests proposed by the challenge 

##### Content
    1. I can see an element with id="break-label" that contains a string (e.g. “Break Length”).
    2. I can see an element with id="session-label" that contains a string (e.g. "Session Length”).
    3. I can see two clickable elements with corresponding IDs: id="break-decrement" and id="session-decrement".
    4. I can see two clickable elements with corresponding IDs: id="break-increment" and id="session-increment".
    5. I can see an element, with corresponding id="break-length", which by default (on load) displays a value of 5.
    6. I can see an element, with corresponding id="session-length", which by default displays a value of 25.
    7. I can see an element, with corresponding id="timer-label", that contains a string indicating a session is initialized (e.g. "Session").
    8. I can see an element with corresponding id="time-left". NOTE: Paused or running, the value in this field should always be displayed in mm:ss format (i.e. 25:00).
    9. I can see a clickable element with corresponding id="start_stop".
    10. I can see a clickable element with corresponding id="reset".

##### Timer
    1. When I click the element with the id of "reset", any running timer should be stopped, the value within id="break-length" should return to 5, the value within id="session-length" should return to 25, and the element with id="time-left" should reset to it's default state.
    2. When I click the element with the id of "break-decrement", the value within id="break-length" decrements by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.
    3. When I click the element with the id of "break-increment", the value within id="break-length" increments by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.
    4. When I click the element with the id of "session-decrement", the value within id="session-length" decrements by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.
    5. When I click the element with the id of "session-increment", the value within id="session-length" increments by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.
    6. I should not be able to set a session or break length to <= 0.
    7. I should not be able to set a session or break length to > 60.
    8. When I first click the element with id="start_stop", the timer should begin running from the value currently displayed in id="session-length", even if the value has been incremented or decremented from the original value of 25.
    9. If the timer is running, the element with the id of "time-left" should display the remaining time in mm:ss format (decrementing by a value of 1 and updating the display every 1000ms).
    10. If the timer is running and I click the element with id="start_stop", the countdown should pause.
    11. If the timer is paused and I click the element with id="start_stop", the countdown should resume running from the point at which it was paused.
    12. When a session countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), and a new countdown begins, the element with the id of "timer-label" should display a string indicating a break has begun.
    13. When a session countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), a new break countdown should begin, counting down from the value currently displayed in the id="break-length" element.
    14. When a break countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), and a new countdown begins, the element with the id of "timer-label" should display a string indicating a session has begun.
    15. When a break countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), a new session countdown should begin, counting down from the value currently displayed in the id="session-length" element.

##### Audio
    1. When a countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), a sound indicating that time is up should play. This should utilize an HTML5 <audio> tag and have a corresponding id="beep".
    2. The audio element with id="beep" must be 1 second or longer.
    3. The audio element with id of "beep" must stop playing and be rewound to the beginning when the element with the id of "reset" is clicked.
